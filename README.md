# Automated-Production-line-
This is the code for an automated  Feeding station in a production line using C embedded 
used C programming (Ardiuino) and embedded concepts to build and control and assembly production line using (interuppts ,timers)
controlled sensors ,switches and solenoid valves
used MATLAB Simulink to test and fully simulate the production line
